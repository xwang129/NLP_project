# what is this py file for?
"""
since we only need to analyze dow30 companies, and we need to do multiple analysis on 2 dictionaries using
two different weighting schemes, i.e. proportional weighting and term weighting, thus it will save a lot of
time if we filtered relevant 10-K files at initial state. We have done the analysis using LM dictionary at this time
thus we may make use of codes wrote for it.
